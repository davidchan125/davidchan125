### Hi, I'm David and I am currently working as a research associate at the University of Westminster!

Recently, our development team at the university finished developing [Î£MARTEST](https://smartestknowledge.org/) (pronounced _sum-artest_ as Î£ can mean "the sum of"), an online learning tool that uses graphs to help supplement learning. We are open to new registrations and appreciate feedback!

<p>Working on SMARTEST has allowed me to develop coding skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has given me experience with MongoDB, Heroku and Node.js (with Express.js!). I also had the opportunity to work with Neo4j as part of other research projects running in parallel to SMARTEST.</p>

<p>Before SMARTEST, I gained experience in Java, C#, MySQL and Swift during my university course and Objective-C shortly after graduating.</p>
  
I can be found on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-chan-you-fee-2533b3148/)!

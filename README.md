### Hi, I'm David and I am currently working as a research associate at the University of Westminster!

The most recent completed project I have contributed to is [Î£MARTEST](https://smartestknowledge.org/) (pronounced _sum-artest_ as Î£ can mean "the sum of") where I was part of a dev team at the University of Westminster. If you are open to trying something new, please sign up as a student and try it out. We also really appreciate feedback!

Working on SMARTEST has allowed me to develop my web development experience working with
- the HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Heroku
- Node.js and Express
<p>I also had the opportunity to work with Neo4j as part of other research projects running in parallel to SMARTEST.</p>

<p>During university, I learned Java, C#, MySQL and Swift. After graduation I learned Objective-C as part of iOS development.</p>

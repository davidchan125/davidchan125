Hi, I'm David, a research associate at the University of Westminster!

The most recent accessible project I have contributed to is called Î£MARTEST (pronounced _sum-artest_), which is accessible [here](https://smartestknowledge.org/). If you are interested in trying out graph-based learning, please sign up as a student and try it out. We really appreciate feedback!

Working on SMARTEST has allowed me to develop my web development experience with:
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- Heroku
- Node.js and Express
- the [vis.js](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/examples/) library (very cool)!
<p>I also had the opportunity to work with the Neo4j graph database as part of other research projects running in parallel to SMARTEST.</p>

<p>My time at university gave me a language skillset in Java, C#, MySQL and Swift, and after graduation I expanded this with Objective-C, as part of an iOS development role.</p>
  
I can be found on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-chan-you-fee-2533b3148/)!
